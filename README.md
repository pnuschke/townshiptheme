# townshiptheme
An open-source wordpress theme for towns and cities

#ABOUT TOWNSHIP THEME
This theme enables a city or town to implement a website on Wordpress with drastically reduced effort over doing something from scratch. I used township theme for my own township's website in order to save them ten of thousands they were about to spend on a custom website (that they didn't need). 

#TOWNSHIP PRINCIPLES
* If text is displayed it should be editable without touching HTML (e.g., liberal use of Settings and custom posts)
* It should use common plug-ins where possible instead of creating custom code within the theme
* Basic style should be editable (it's not there yet), but for advanced styling, it's better if designers/developers do their own layouts/designs and use this theme for functionality
